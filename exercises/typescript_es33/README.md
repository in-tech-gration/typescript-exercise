# 33 - ADVANCED OBJECT TYPES: Deep Types

STEP: 

* In the code editor, we’re going to continue working on our operating system. This time, we added a config property to the DesktopDirectory class. The data in config will be needed for every Directory, so let’s add it to the Directory interface. Inside the Directory interface, add a config type member that matches the config property of DesktopDirectory. You should write a type that has a nested default object.
* In the terminal run tsc to compile your code.
* Run node index.js in the terminal to see the output. You should see output about the configuration of DesktopDirectory.
