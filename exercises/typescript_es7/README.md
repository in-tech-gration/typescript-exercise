# 07 - FUNCTIONS: Documenting Functions

We grabbed a few functions from earlier exercises. They are sorely missing some documentation commentsâ€¦

Add a documentation comment makeFruitSalad() function. Your comment should include:

* A brief description of what the function does.
* A first @param tag for the first parameter.
* A second @param tag for the second parameter.
* A @returns tag explaining what the function returns (in this case, nothing).

Add a documentation comment proclaim() function. Your comment should include:

* A brief description of what the function does.
* A first @param tag for the first parameter.
* A second @param tag for the second parameter.
* An @returns tag explaining what the function returns (again, in this case, nothing).
