# 17 - CUSTOM TYPES: Type Aliases

STEP:

* In the code editor, you should see something familiar. This code was the “improved” version of the navigation example in a previous lesson. Here, we can improve it even more by replacing a long, awkward type annotation with a short, supple type alias. First, create the type alias Coord to stand for the coordinate tuple type. It should be of the same type as codecademyCoordinates and bermudaTCoordinates.
* Now, replace the old, long type annotations for codecademyCoordinates and bermudaTCoordinates with annotations that use your new type alias.
