# 11 - ARRAYS: Array Type Inference

STEP:

* Letâ€™s do a tricky example. We have defined the tuple dogTup in the code editor. Your challenge is to define a variable myArr of the type string[]. Not so fast! The hard part is that you are not allowed to use the word Array, or the characters [ and ]. Use the .concat() method and your wits to solve the problem.
* You figured it out! Now demonstrate that myArr is an array rather than a tuple by adding the code myArr[50] = 'not a dog' and running tsc. If myArr were a tuple, accessing element 50 would be impossible!
